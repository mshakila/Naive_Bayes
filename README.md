# Naive_Bayes
There are 2 problem statements:
   1. Using salary dataset, classifying into 2 salary classes: <=50K or >50K
   2. Using spam-ham dataset, classifying emails into 2 types: spam or ham

I have solved this using both R and Python. 
I have used different Naive Bayes models and also compared with Logistic regression model . 
To improve performance, I have used laplace smoothing.
